secondorderdemos
================

Demos of second order algorithms for multi class classification.

The algorithms are described in 
[this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1949)

You will need to have [mnist_all.mat]
(http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data/mnist_all.mat)
in the same directory for the demos to work.

cosplaydriver runs the following algorithms on the mnist digit dataset
* calibrated least squares (algorithm 2 from the paper) 
* generalized least squares (algorithm 1 from the paper)
* stagewise regression (algorithm 3 from the paper)
